LiteLLM, a library that provides a unified interface for interacting with over 100 different LLMs 
including GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and many others. By using a single interface, we can 
easily switch between different models without changing our code, making it perfect for testing 
different LLMs or having fallback options in production. This will also allow us to make our agent 
reusable across LLMs â€” although we may need to do some prompt engineering to make it work with a new LLM.
